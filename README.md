# instaSTEM: ML-Powered Classifier for STEM Content on Instagram

**instaSTEM** is an early-stage machine learning project designed to identify and classify STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) content on Instagram, starting with captions.

## Inspiration

I came up with this idea while watching a [video](https://youtu.be/3i59t2i7lhM?feature=shared) by [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson), where he reviewed several TikToks featured in TikTok’s new STEM feed. That video made me realize how powerful a dedicated educational content filter can be — and how Instagram still doesn’t have anything like it.  
This sparked the idea to build a tool that can help surface meaningful STEM content on platforms where it often gets buried under entertainment overload.

## Vision

In a world filled with short-form entertainment, educational content often gets overlooked. TikTok has addressed this with its dedicated STEM feed — Instagram has not. This project aims to bridge that gap using machine learning.

The long-term vision:
- Build a personalized STEM feed for Instagram
- Use intelligent content filtering to elevate science and tech creators
- Eventually expand to other platforms like YouTube Shorts and Reddit
- Enable filtering by subtopics (AI, physics, math, etc.)

## What’s Been Built So Far

- A working machine learning model trained to classify Instagram captions as either **STEM** or **Non-STEM**
- Dataset of 500+ labeled Instagram captions
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, cleaning, hashtag retention)
- TF-IDF vectorizer with bi-grams
- Logistic Regression model
- Model and vectorizer saved as `.pkl` files for future app integration

## What’s Not Built Yet

- No user interface (web or mobile)
- No browser extension or automation
- No deployment
- No multi-platform support (yet)

## What's Next

- Build a minimal web app using Streamlit or Flask
- Develop a Chrome extension or mobile wrapper to apply filtering on Instagram
- Improve the model with transformer-based classifiers (e.g., BERT)
- Add support for sub-topic classification (e.g., Math, CS, Physics)
- Explore cross-platform STEM feed aggregation (Reddit, YouTube Shorts)

## Looking for Contributors

This is currently a solo project, and I’m looking for contributors to collaborate on the next phases.

You’re welcome to contribute if you’re into:
- Frontend development (React, Tailwind, Streamlit)
- Backend development (Flask, FastAPI)
- Browser extensions
- NLP and transformer models
- UI/UX design
- Dataset expansion or annotation
- Full-stack or MLOps

If you’re passionate about building tools that help make educational content more accessible, I’d love to work with you.

## How to Run the Model Locally

```bash
# Clone the repo and install dependencies
pip install scikit-learn pandas

# In your Python script or notebook:
import pickle

with open("instaSTEM.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

with open("tfidf_vectorizer.pkl", "rb") as f:
    vectorizer = pickle.load(f)

def predict_caption(text):
    cleaned = text.lower()
    vec = vectorizer.transform([cleaned])
    return "STEM" if model.predict(vec)[0] == 1 else "Non-STEM"

# Example usage
predict_caption("Building a Python script to automate math problems")
